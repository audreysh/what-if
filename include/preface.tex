\chapter{Preface}

This is an introductory textbook on non-classical logics. Or rather,
it will be when it's done.  Right now it's a work in progress. We will
use it as the main text in our courses on non-classical logic at the
Universities of Victoria and Calgary, respectively, in Fall 2020. It
is based on material from the \href{https://openlogicproject.org}{Open
Logic Project}.

The main text assumes familiarity with some elementary set theory and
the basics of (propositional) logic. The textbook
\href{https://slc.openlogicproject.org}{\emph{Sets, Logic,
Computation}}, is also based on the OLP, provides this background. But
the required material is also included here: the basics of classical
propositional logic in \cref{part:classical}, and the material on set
theory, and some introductory material on proofs and induction, in
\cref{appendices}.
